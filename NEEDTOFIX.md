## Issues Fixed

### âœ… Admin Feature Access Issue
**Problem**: Admin accounts weren't showing feature permissions that were set in the admin panel, while regular accounts with plans were showing them correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `getUserFeatures` API function only returned features for users with active billing/subscriptions, but admin users might not have billing records.

**Solution**: Updated the `getUserFeatures` function in `/src/server/api/routers/feature-permissions.ts` to check if the user is an admin first, and if so, return all available features before checking billing status.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/server/api/routers/feature-permissions.ts` - Added admin check to `getUserFeatures` function
